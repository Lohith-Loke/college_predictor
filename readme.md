# params to consider 
we have an exam thats conducted for college admission.every body takes the exam
gets a rank. The top scorrer gets rank 1 and there can be multiple people
holding same rank. 
admissions are based on simple criteria.the choice of low rank student (that is
toopers) are first served seats and then high rank student's choice is taken.

we have opening and clossing rank,opening rank is lowest rank of the student
(the topper's) rank that choose that college and that course.closing rank is
rank of student highest rank that college allowed seat for. 

given this details what are the things that need to be taken to consideration if 
we were to build a model that predicts next year's closing rank 


### total number of students that took exam in every year 
### how to reputation score of a college ie college that more student's wish to go to 
### course popularity , number that tells intrested candidates are in said courese
